# Wine-price-analysis

In our analysis, I used a Random Forest Regressor to predict wine prices based on various factors from the dataset. 
However, my findings consistently showed a low accuracy, roughly 20-30%. 
This suggests that there might be limited correlation between the chosen features and wine prices.

It's important to consider a few key factors. The low accuracy could be due to missing essential features, the complexity of wine pricing,
or non-linear relationships that my model can't capture.  To improve the accuracy, I recommend further exploration of the data, i
ncluding feature engineering, collecting more data, or trying alternative models.
